2D Multilayer Applications

Bubble - Simple radially symmetric test problem with a jump in bathymetry
         where the bottom layer becomes dry.  Works with all eigenspace
         methods.
Hurricane - Storm surge test cases.  All test cases work currently.
Plane Wave - Test case with a plane wave hitting a jump in bathymetry
             where the bottom layer becomes dry at different angles.  
             All tests work.
Idealized - Test cases meant to test basic Riemann solver, not tested.
chesapeake - Storm surge in chesapeake bay.  Not tested.
shelf - Storm surge with a jump discontinuity for the shelf slope.
        Not tested.
stommel - Simple stommel problem setup for the multi-layer equations.
          Not tested.
