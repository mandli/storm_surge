Two Layer Shallow Water Equations Examples - 1D

To run all the examples in this directory, use

    python run_tests.py all
    
or some other combination of the tests located in that script.  All the tests
are defined by running the base setrun.py in this directory and then each of
the tests in run_tests.py overrides the appropriate parameters to start the 
test.  The script run_tests.py also tries to run as many simulations at the 
same time as there are cores.

The tests included are:

    idealized - Test cases with simple Riemann problems as the setup.
    drystate - Dry state dam break problem, demonstrates the entropy fix.
    oscillatory - Oscillatory wind field applied to two-layer flow, 
                  demonstrates the loss of hyperbolicity.
    shelf - Test cases involving oceanic scales with a continental shelf of
            varying complexity.
            
The other python scripts are for data analysis and plotting which includes:

    compare_eigen.py - Compares each of the different eigen methods to
                       eachother.
    shelf_contour.py - Produces contours of the surfaces in time and space.
    shelf_convergence.py - Basic convergence plotting of shelf simulations.
