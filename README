README for Storm Surge Code

This repository contains the code needed to solve the multi-layer shallow
water equations in 1d and 2d using Clawpack and GeoClaw.  The code does not 
include versions of Clawpack and GeoClaw and these packages must be downloaded
separately.  The best option is to clone the Clawpack-4.x repository from 
github.com (as of September 1, 2011).
