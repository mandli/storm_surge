**Multi-Layer Shallow Water Equations**

Solves the modified multilayer system similar to that found in

containing a slightly different flux function for the bottom layer but the 
source terms are mirrored.  Here we use the eigen-system found by linearizing
about the steady state rho_1 h_1 and rho_2 h_2.
